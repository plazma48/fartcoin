## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much ƒarticles will ever exist? 

With every block mined the reward drops, this means that instead of halving the reward suddenly every 200k blocks Fartcoin mining reward drops constant until block 10.000.000 where it stays at a constant 1 FART per block + miningfee.

Total Fartcoins generated after 10000000 blocks = 166953103.60862600
1 Block per minute = 43800 Blocks per Month
Miners will mine 525600 blocks per year 
Month1 = 112.6 Million FartCoins 
Month2 = 119.6 
Month3 = 123.6
Month4 = 126.5
Month5 = 128.7
Month6 = 130.6

Year1  = 137.5 Million FartCoins
Year2  = 143.9
Year3  = 147.9 
Year4  = 151.3
Year10 = 160.5
After 19 years fixed reward per block Every Year + 525600 FartCoins
